# Specification Quality Checklist: git-wire Subfolder Fetch

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation 2026-10-05, iteration 1: all items pass. Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
  markers by design — scope decisions (subcommand placement, GitHub-style URL
  shape, colocated tracking record, sibling update/list operations) recorded as
  explicit Assumptions. CLI surface (`git-wire`, `-t/--target-path`) is
  user-facing contract, not implementation detail. No spec rework required.
